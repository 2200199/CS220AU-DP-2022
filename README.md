Goals
Define Digital citizenship
In the archives of London, we explored old global citizenship passports. 800 people were interested in becoming a digital citizen and signed up to receive these passports.  A digital citizen is the closest we’ve gotten to achieving global citizenship. The internet allows for people all over the world to have a platform and identity. According to Coed Tech, some Key Digital Rights are the:
Right to access and use computers and/or other electronic devices
Right to access and use digital content
Right to create and share digital media
Right to privacy in digital communities
Right to express your ideas and opinions freely
Right to report anyone or anything that seems inappropriate
Some Digital Citizenship responsibilities are:
Use appropriate language and behavior when interacting with others (i.e. no cyberbullying)
Respect the opinions and ideas of others
Obey all intellectual property laws
Do not use or share others' work without permission
Follow rules and/or codes of conduct for every Internet site 
Responsibility to report cyberbullying, threats, and inappropriate use of digital resources
Define Digital Identity 
In class we analyzed a map created for Jisc Digital Leaders Programme, called V&R. According to Professor David White, "The mapping process V&R stands for a Visitors and Residents based group activity which is designed to explore individuals engagement with the Web. It’s a good starting point for discovering how staff, students or clients are using the Web." Imagine a spectrum from Visitor to Resident, where visitors leave the least traceable impact online, and residents leave the most. Where you land on this spectrum is your digital identity.
Make V&R map for Mom and brother
To see where you land on the spectrum, you can make a V&R map. Draw a horizontal line from Visitor to Resident. The, draw a vertical line from Personal to Institutional. Depending on your email, social media, and search engine activity, where do you have the most presence on the map?
General idea: mom is more of a visitor and Leo is more of a resident
Podcast Questions
Are we more or less free with the rise of digital citizenship?
What type of digital citizen are you?
What role does your digital identity play in your real life?
I have friends all over the world. Grandma lives in California. Cousins live in Vietnam. Dad’s best friend lives in Australia. Cousins live in Tahiti. Would it be possible to maintain long distance relationships without digital citizenships?
Now that we’ve talked about your online presence and interactions, how does this relate to the spread of information, specifically about natural disasters?
Information about the eruption of the world’s largest volcano was spread globally. Did you see a difference in how it was perceived globally vs. right in your backyard?
In Hawai’i, we live in conjunction with natural disasters. This ranges from hurricanes, to tsunamis, to fires, to exploding volcanos. 
If natural disaster were to occur, and a flood or fire took our possessions, our digital identities would still exist in the cloud, even examples of Papa’s business. Try to expand this idea and line of questioning.
